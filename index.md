# Intro to Python for Libraries: API Focus


This lesson has been adapted from Library Carpentry's Introduction to Python for Libararies course to focus specifically on the skills needed to create a basic API query using UBC Library's Open Collections API.


Original introductory content has been preserved below, and the full original course can be found at: https://data-lessons.github.io/library-python-intro/


This lesson is an introduction to programming in Python
for librarians with little or no previous programming experience.
It uses examples that are relevant to a wide range of library use cases,
and is designed to be used as a prerequisite lesson for other Python based lessons
that will be developed in the future, e.g. using the Pandas for data analysis.

This lesson references the Spyder IDE,
but can be taught using a regular Python interpreter as well.
Please note that this lesson uses Python 3 rather than Python 2.
